# Objective:
Develop a terminal-based simulation game using Java 17 to learn and explore advanced Java concepts, with a focus on dynamic code, clean coding principles, and maintainable design.

# Game Overview:

A fully terminal-based simulation game where players interact with various game elements through a text interface.
The game serves as a platform to experiment with Java 17's features and improve your understanding of the inner workings of the language.
Learning Goals:

# Master the fundamentals of Java 17:
Explore new features such as records, sealed classes, pattern matching, and switch expressions for improved code clarity and performance.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a focus on security:
Implement well-structured OOP designs with proper encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Ensure secure coding practices by protecting data integrity and controlling access to objects and methods.
Dynamic and maintainable code:
Create dynamic code structures that are flexible, adaptable, and easy to extend as the game grows in complexity.
Focus on clean code principles to ensure the project remains readable and maintainable, using design patterns where appropriate.
Core Focus Areas:

# Full terminal-based gameplay:
The game will be operated entirely from the terminal, making it a pure learning experience focused on logic and Java 17’s capabilities, without distractions from graphics or external libraries.
Data management and synchronization:
Use object-oriented principles to model in-game entities, ensuring efficient data handling and proper synchronization between various game elements.
Dynamic coding for readability:
Prioritize clear, readable code through dynamic data handling (e.g., using Java 17’s record types for concise data structures).
Leverage functional programming elements like lambda expressions and stream APIs for better code flow and reduced complexity.
Challenges and Concepts to Explore:

# Security-focused OOP:
Implement security measures such as input validation, controlled access, and secure object manipulation to avoid common vulnerabilities.
Java 17 features for dynamic code:
Utilize pattern matching and enhanced switch expressions to make decision-making processes more readable and maintainable.
Integrate sealed classes to define clear hierarchies and constraints in the game’s design, ensuring that class hierarchies remain well-structured.
Code maintainability:
Follow clean coding practices like meaningful naming, code modularization, and adherence to SOLID principles to keep the codebase manageable.
Key Features:

# Terminal-inspired gameplay:
Players interact with the game through commands, receiving dynamic responses based on game states.
OOP data modeling: Use object-oriented design to represent in-game entities (e.g., characters, resources) with an emphasis on clear and secure data management.
Dynamic code readability: Ensure that the code remains easy to read and maintain by making full use of Java 17's dynamic features and best practices for clean coding.
Focus:

This project is meant to learn and push your limits with Java 17, aiming to explore dynamic coding, clean and maintainable design, and mastering modern Java principles. It serves as both a learning experience and an opportunity to practice security, maintainability, and real-world coding techniques.
